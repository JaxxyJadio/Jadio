frontend.html with Heavy Inline Documentation

This is the standalone frontend for Jadio-quick-llm, designed for personal, LAN-only use.
It provides a modern, responsive chat UI, file tree browser, and file viewer for interacting with the backend FastAPI server.

Design assumptions:
- This file is served either directly (file://) or by the backend (main.py) on a trusted LAN.
- All API endpoints are open and permissive, safe only for private, single-user networks.
- No authentication, rate limiting, or advanced security is present by design.
- Interacts with /api/chat, /api/filetree, and /api/file endpoints as described in README.md and flowguide.md.
- All inference and file access is performed on the server (PC 2); this UI is just a client.

If you are reading this in the future, remember: this file is optimized for simplicity, maintainability, and rapid iteration in a trusted environment.
